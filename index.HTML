        <h1>Ukraine-Russia War</h1>                 
        <h1>Background of Ukraine-Russia war:</h1>
        <img src="Ukraine russia warv 1.webp" alt="natural" class="center">
        <ul>
          <li>Ukraine became an independent state in 1991 after the disintegration of the USSR. Ukraine is the largest country in Europe and has a large border with Russia. Russia has always been apprehensive of its security as major attacks on Russia have occurred from the western border, like in World War 1 and World War 2. </li>
          <li>Ukraine’s desire to join NATO made Russia apprehensive of its security, and it captured Crimea in 2014. Russia also supported insurgents in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in Eastern Ukraine.          </li>
          <li>The war between Russia and Ukraine has increased trade ambiguity and significantly influenced oil prices and other commodities. Despite having little trade with Russia, India suffers economically due to supply disruptions by Western nations.</li>
      </ul>

        <h1>Reasons for Ukraine-Russia War</h1>
        <img src="uka-rus 2.jpeg" alt="natural" class="center">
        <ul>
          <li>The main reason behind the Russia-Ukraine Conflict or Why Russia and Ukraine are Fighting is because Ukraine acceded to NATO, which would go against Russia’s wishes and continue to endanger its security. The west, according to Russia, should guarantee that Ukraine will never get permission to be part of NATO.</li>
          <li>Economic Factor: Ukraine has a large population, and it has substantial natural minerals and resources which also produce wheat, and vegetable oil, which are supposed to play an important role. Ukraine’s membership in the Eurasian Economic Community (EAEC), a free trade agreement that came into being in 2015, but Ukraine refused to join the agreement.</li>
          <li>Joining NATO of Ukraine will result in installing missiles, a missile defence system at the mouth of Moscow.</li>
      </ul>
        
        <h1>Key events</h1>

      <h1>Media and Propaganda of Ukraine-Russia</h1>
      <img src="propaganda 3.jpg" alt="natural" class="center">
      <ul>
        <li>Russia's war in Ukraine isn't just being fought on the ground and in the air with tanks, artillery and fighter jets. It's also playing out online, where the Kremlin and its allies are using propaganda, fake social media accounts, forged documents and manipulated videos and images to push false narratives, in an effort to deflect blame from Moscow and undermine support for Ukraine.</li>
        <li>A year into the conflict, Russia continues to deploy false and misleading claims to justify its actions, cast Ukraine and NATO as the aggressors, and deny responsibility for the war.</li>
        <li>The video—a crude deepfake that had been posted by hackers—was quickly taken down and debunked. It was dismissed by the real Zelensky as a “childish provocation,” and roundly mocked online as an example of Russia’s desperate and often cartoonish attempts to spread fake news.</li>
